Storefront In Hot Les Gallery District,"I was interested in creating a space that is more than a traditional gallery but one that is multi-use and interdisciplinary, appealing to a broader community. We began 6 years ago (though my career as an artist and curator spans three decades) in DUMBO, Brooklyn and moved to our 2700 sq ft space on the Lower East Side gallery district more than 2 years ago, expanding to three times our original size. This allows us the space to grow and to partner with others. From our all window façade (even our door is all glass) the Gallery is set up as a cabinet of curiosities, focusing on more than 120 international artists, drawing in passersby from the street. A half wall separates it from Space where I curate 4 exhibitions yearly on themes of art and science during the regular season. Another half wall with shelves on the reverse side brings us to the Project Space. We have our own programming and when not in use, we make available to our broader community.

We are fully equipped with track lighting and plenty of wall space, heating/air conditioning, wifi, mounted projector, pedestals/shelves, chairs/tables and bathroom. The space can be open to the public or remain private. Gallery assistants are on hand during our hours (Thursday-Sunday, 12-6pm) and as arranged. And we are situated very conveniently just a block from the subway.

In addition, we offer you our expertise, assistance, contacts and publicity. We can introduce you to collaborators, collectors, and curators. We publicize any of your events that are open to the public, with our extensive readymade New York and international community and through social media. 

Though we can be used for an occasional meeting or meet-up, it is also available for longer term rental as a workspace/office space.

Our space especially is perfect for:

•	Curators and artists: a wonderful location for pop-up exhibitions, with exposure to our international clientele. 

•	Designers and agents: a clean, well equipped space for presentations and showcases, with professional assistance available in installing and lighting,.

•	Performers: perfect for that intimate setting required for certain theater, dance or interdisciplinary projects.

•	Discussion groups and workshops: hold your one day, weekly or monthly meetings and seminars here!


Pricing for the Event space begins at $1000 for a weekend booking. Discounts for multiple bookings and ongoing space partnerships as well.

The Brewery Floor: Available for use when the beer isn’t being made, this is a large space with an industrial factory vibe.  It is incredibly modular and has been used for yoga sessions, painting classes, salsa dancing, private dinners, and even as a set for the TV show Gotham.  

The Backyard: Hands down the best private outdoor drinking & party space in The Bronx, this is a large space perfect for outdoor public & private parties, events, and gatherings when the weather is warm. Features include: picnic tables, patio umbrellas, and a stage for live music making it an ideal urban beer garden. It is nestled between the factory and train tracks and provides a fantastic old NYC feeling in modern times.

Spacious Studio Space Near Navy Yard / Steiner Studios Area,"DESCRIPTION

This is a multifunctional workspace nested in a professional context. It’s industrial details frame a perfect transitory work location, while it’s amenities make it a welcoming and warm space. It’s layout permits different arrangements and uses according to your specific needs.

The studio is divided into two main areas - a larger area that can be used for example as photo studio, projection room, meeting area, exhibition space and a smaller room that can become an intimate portrait studio, a beauty or dressing area, a kitchenette or a service area. 

The furniture included with the space rental has this versatility in mind as almost everything is on wheels or light enough that can be moved around with little effort. The space can be partially emptied upon special request and under specific conditions.

Some of the uses we find adequate: portraits, editorials, look-books, castings, private hairstyling sessions, fashion and design showroom, art vernissages, small workshops and events, production holdings and art gallery space.

If we don’t have what you need, we can offer support for your production for an additional service fee.

Neighborhood overview
Williamsburg is a mixed mixed light industrial/residential Historic District filled with old homes, longstanding shops and creative co working, tech and industrial spaces. Greenpoint is a tree lined green neighborhood with lots of small shops, from butchers to boutiques and has a history of its own. I love this neighborhood, because it is right on the border of both. I love the close proximity to restaurants, and other neighborhoods. It is a short walking distance to restaurants and shops on Graham and Manhattan Avenues but also centrally located and only 11 minutes Union Square and the East Village via the L. There are so many great things to do here. I am walking distance to three parks (McCarren, McGolrick and Cooper), the brand new Broklyn Steel music venue and walking distance to Bedford Avenue with even more music venues. This neighborhood has something for everyone. in the past few years, we have experienced the explosion of music and art over the neighborhood, and the pulse of creativity brewing all around us is something we do not take for granted.",75,5,https://www.peerspace.com/pages/listings/596e2a47f2b40f25011d4bcc,"Greenpoint, Kings County, NY"

The Neighborhood

Located in Bushwick (1 minute away from Jefferson subway stop), you will find yourself in walking distance from several bars, restaurants, galleries and grocery stores.

The Space

Living in NYC can make us feel a bit claustrophobic at times. The buildings, cars, and masses of people can get repetitive. Having lived here for over a decade, we´ve come to appreciate those special, and rare spaces where you feel like your not in New York. 

We decided to remake our backyard into a Brooklyn tropical paradise, where you´ll feel tele transported to an exotic island, just by walking in. If you want to soak in some sun by the pool,  and roast  smores by the fire pit at night without leaving New York City, Villa Carmen is the only place for you. 

We love cooking and host weekly dinners at Villa Carmen (yes, we gave it a name) with our friends. We offer the possibility to cater your event, with everything from  sangrias, brunches, paellas, and custom BBQ´s. We use organic and locally sourced produce whenever possible, and care very much for our guests at Villa Carmen, so we always take allergies into consideration. Just tell us what you want and we´ll try to make it happen!

Bright Mid Century Inspired Greenpoint Apartment,"Thanks for checking out our space! Our apartment is bright, clean, and filled with plants! We have decorated with a mix of Mid Century Modern, vintage, and contemporary furniture. 

The third floor apartment opens up to a small galley style kitchen and leads into our bedroom. Our bedroom has one large window that faces McGolrick Park. Our living room has clean white walls, light colored tiled floors, and two large windows that get really great light throughout the day.

Our apartment has been successfully used in interior design, wedding decor shoots, and simply for lifestyle photos. Our space has also been used for production photos of blankets, fabric, and decor items. Because we live here, the photos tend to reflect a more realistic and lived-in vibe.

We're located a block away from McGolrick Park, which is a historic strolling park with huge mature trees. (We think it's the most beautiful park in the city!) The middle of the park houses a classical brick and limestone Shelter Pavilion. Within a five minute walk you can find Variety Coffee, Pie Corps, Goldies Bar, The Drift Bar, Vinnies Pizza, and Selamat Pagi. 

The bedroom is approximately 9.5' by 13'.

"Warehouse Space, Open Box, Ground Floor With Lot. 2000 Square Feet.","Located across the street from the Radegast Hall & Biergarten, Mast Brothers Chocolate Makers and next to the Levee bar in North Williamsburg, this is a space that includes a 2 roll down gates in the front that lock up overnight with an open lot and a 3 step entrance to an open warehouse space.  It's white washed drywall inside, with a corrugated metal and I-beam ceiling and includes air-conditioning and heat.  Would work well for film and television back end, extra holding, or ""urban/industrial"" photo and film shoots. As it is basically a blank slate, it could really become anything you want. The inside space is 24 feet wide by 30 feet deep with an 11-foot ceiling and double doors leading to a loading dock. Lighting is fluorescent and/or strings of incandescent lighting, as can be seen in the photos. The strings of lighting can be removed, if necessary (please inquire in advance of booking if needed). The beams can easily support any lighting you might want to install for your purposes. 

The outside lot is 34 feet wide by 37 feet deep and can accommodate box-truck parking. We have a wooden staircase in front that can be moved for load-in and load-out, so trucks can pull right up to the dock. There is also a separate 25 foot by 15 foot rehearsal studio in the back that can be rented for an additional fee. This room is somewhat sound-proofed and contains a full back line of guitar amps, bass amp, drum set, PA and mics, as well as a separate heating and cooling system, so if the front area needed to be open to the outside for your purposes, there would still be a separate temperature controlled area for makeup, wardrobe or other purposes. That sound equipment can also be rented out for the main area for a separate fee. There is a single bathroom (as in one person at a time) that is kept clean and stocked. 

Also included in the regular rental, would be 70 white folding chairs, 2 6-foot fold out banquet tables, a 4 foot round table, a 5-foot by five-shelf metro shelving unit and a small desk with a basic pc, wifi and router for direct connection to the network. Connected to that is an amplifier that runs speakers in the interior and/or outdoor speakers for the front lot.

The neighborhood
Here is what Vague Magazine has to say about Bushwick after rating it the 7th coolest neighborhood in the world to live: ""As far as buzz goes, few neighborhoods garner as much attention—globally—as Bushwick. Believe the hype: this area, located in north Brooklyn, claims cutting-edge galleries (like an outpost of Luhring Augustine, which reps Christopher Wool, Joel Sternfeld, and the very much in demand Jeff Elrod) to Jay Z–approved restaurants (Enter: Roberta’s). Pop-up late-nights, an eatery in a defunct gas station—check out the recently opened Montana’s Trailhouse—and a vinyl-recycling jewelry label called Wrecords By Monkey are all within a few blocks. Time to hop on the L!""

I live in this apartment with my husband. We're both artists and men of many trades. We would love to share our space for photo, film, or video shoots. 

It's also a great space for holding - Plenty of room for hair, makeup, and wardrobe, with a full kitchen & bathroom.

We're offering comfortable shooting access to this historic lower east side / Chinatown neighborhood - a highly coveted area with an endless amount of amazing, nearby locations. 
   
The apartment is located on the first floor of a classic Chinatown-Lower East Side tenement style building from the turn of the century. It's just a 5 step walk up and at the end of the hallway.

The apartment consists of 2 railroad-style rooms that measure 200 square feet each. There is a bathroom and a short hallway at the entrance which can be very useful for perspective purposes. 

We put a lot of love and dedication into the decor and look of our place. We both care a lot about comfort and aesthetics. We are very proud to say that the place feels very much like a charming, old-school downtown Manhattan artistic apartment. 

It's not renovated but in great condition, freshly painted this past February and filled with very attractive and curious objects and props (as well as books, records, posters, paintings, murals, images and original artwork). 

Something that might be of interest is that it's facing the back of the building. There is access to the fire escape stairs through one of the windows with a very big and photogenic alley way that has been used many times for shoots because it has this classic decadent, overgrown, urban look to it.
